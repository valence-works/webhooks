# ADR 0001: Use GitHub Spec Kit

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-28

## Context

We need a lightweight, consistent way to define and communicate software requirements and technical decisions across this repository.

## Decision

We will use GitHub Spec Kit as the standard approach for writing and managing specifications in this project.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improves consistency in how specifications are documented.
- Makes specs easier to review and collaborate on in GitHub workflows.
- Provides a clear, shared format for contributors.

### Trade-offs

- Contributors need to learn the Spec Kit structure and conventions.
- Existing or ad hoc specs may require migration over time.

## Notes

This ADR establishes the baseline documentation decision. Follow-up ADRs can refine usage patterns, templates, and governance as needed.
